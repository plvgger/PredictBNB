- **Wagmi** & **RainbowKit** for Web3 integration
- **React Query** for state management

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** for contract development
- **Hardhat** for development and deployment
- **OpenZeppelin** for security standards

### Blockchain
- **BNB Smart Chain** for low fees and fast transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Compile contracts:
```bash
npm run compile
```

2. Deploy to BSC testnet:

## How It Works

### Market Creation
1. Users connect their wallet
2. Create a new market with a question and possible outcomes
3. Set an end time for the market
4. Pay a small BNB fee to create the market

### Trading
1. Browse available markets
2. Select an outcome you believe will happen
3. Buy shares using BNB
4. Share prices reflect market probability

### Resolution
1. Markets resolve automatically at the end time
2. Winning shares can be redeemed for BNB
3. A small fee (2%) is taken by the platform
